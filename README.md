# Release Tracker

## 🧐 About

It is my first API related work for learning purpose.

Two database model are used (Apicall & Newrelease).

Database associations are not set since; API call model is used only for keep access token.

Other model, New release is used to keep client search requests.

## API Keys

Secret / API Keys are kept in local .yml file instead of using Figaro GEM to secure the private keys.
